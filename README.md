# Capstone Project : The Battle of Neighborhoods
Clustering Analysis of Toronto Neighborhoods

## 1.	Business Problem
This study is aimed to help a small vegan restaurant/bar willing to open a new location in Toronto. The investors easily agreed to expand their activities in one of its neighborhoods as Toronto is the most populated city in Canada with high quality of living. 
Beyond this information, the investors seem to struggle in gathering sufficient details that will help them identify the appropriate location in Toronto where to establish their facility. Therefore, they requested an analysis of the Toronto market to drive their decision.

The suitable location is described as follow by the investors: 
*	A neighborhood with an average to above average total population
*	Above average populations of 25â€“40-year-old male and female professionals
* A high concentration of the population having secondary education
*	Average to above average median net household incomes

The goal of this analysis is to identify and recommend to the investors which neighborhood(s) of Toronto will be the best choice to establish their facility. The target audience is vegan oriented businesses and restaurants/bars. Starting from these requirements and using data about neighborhoods population, activities and venues, the study will highlight most attractive opportunities.
